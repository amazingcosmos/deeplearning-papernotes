# Interaction Content Aware Network Embedding via Co-embedding of Vertices
and Edges

## My Notes

- In loss function Eq.(4), why the **penalty** of exising (vertex, edge) pairs  
 was put as an additional number beside **probability** of existing (vertex, vertex) pairs. Does it 
 need to be treated as an indivisual penalty?
